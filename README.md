# Recommendation System API

Content recommender system built with FastAPI and CatBoost, using user behavior, post text, and LightGCN embeddings.  
Developed as a pet project to learn top-N recommendation modeling, A/B testing, and API integration.

This project includes two recommendation models with different feature sets and a full A/B test pipeline to compare their performance on held-out data.

## Project Description

###  Data:
- Feed log: 76 million user interaction rows collected over 3 months from 2021-10-01 to 2021-12-31  
- Data on 163K users and 7K posts  
- Stored in PostgreSQL (accessed via Redash)

### Feed data fields:
| Field name | Overview                                                                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timestamp` | Time when the view happened                                                                 |
| `user_id`   | ID of the user who performed the action                                                     |
| `post_id`   | ID of the post that was viewed                                                              |
| `action`    | Type of action: view or like                                                                |

### User data fields:
| Field name | Overview                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `age`      | User age (from profile)                          |
| `city`     | User city (from profile)                         |
| `country`  | User country (from profile)                      |
| `exp_group`| Experimental group: an encrypted category       |
| `gender`   | User gender                                      |
| `user_id`  | Unique user identifier                           |
| `os`       | Operating system of the device                   |
| `source`   | Whether the user came from organic traffic or ads|

### Post data fields:
| Field name | Overview                 |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `id`       | Unique post identifier   |
| `text`     | Text content of the post |
| `topic`    | Main topic of the post   |

### Goal:
- Build a model to predict the probability that a user will like a post  
- Implement a service returning the top N posts ranked by this probability

### Completed:
- Preprocessing and feature engineering done in notebooks  
- User and post embeddings generated with LightGCN  
- Text features extracted from posts (TFIDF + TruncatedSVD)  
- Two CatBoost models trained: baseline and extended with extra features  
- Integrated into FastAPI app with PostgreSQL connection  
- A/B test implemented to compare models on held-out data  
- Recommendation API filters out already liked posts

### A/B Test Methodology
An A/B test was conducted on held-out user interactions from December 2021 to compare the two recommendation models:

- **Control group** received recommendations from the baseline model (fewer features)  
- **Test group** received recommendations from the enhanced model (with topic-level like rates, lexical features, and LightGCN embeddings)

**Evaluation metrics:**
- `HitRate@5`: checks whether at least one liked post is present in the top-5 recommended

Each user was deterministically assigned to an experiment group using a hash function on their user ID to simulate real-life A/B testing.

### Results:
| Metric         | Control Model | Test Model |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| AUC            | 0.773         | **0.82**   |
| HitRate@5      | 0.611         | **0.706**  |
